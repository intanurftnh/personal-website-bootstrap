                <div class="fs-5 m-3" style="text-align: justify;">
                    <p>I joined the Samsung Innovation Campus Batch 2 Bootcamp in August 2023, precisely when I was in the 2nd grade of vocational school. I did some programming language exercises like HTML, CSS, and Java Script individually. Then I got a friend group of 4 people. We have the main task of creating a website-based application. With our cooperation in the process of determining ideas, design solutions, to creating websites using programming languages, we managed to create a simple application called Eyeroom.</p>
                    <p>We went through a difficult time in the process of learning coding for approximately 5 months. Moreover, we are in the process of studying at school, making us more challenged to be able to manage time. The thing that made me run this bootcamp was when I gained new knowledge in my life, namely learning website coding, being able to greet new friends from outside the city and even the island, and of course meeting great mentors who had taught us all from scratch to successfully making applications. While the difficulty for us is when the process of making applications for us is a challenge in itself to achieve, besides that we are faced with other groups who have ideas and design solutions that may be more powerful and interesting.</p>
                    <p>For me personally, attending this bootcamp and learning to code with HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages is a new thing in my life. With the learning process that I think is quite short, I sometimes have a little difficulty catching up. But I didn't expect to be able to do it. I will not forget the experience during my time attending this bootcamp.</p>
                    <p>The results of the four of our hard work in the process of making the Eyeroom application paid off quite perfectly. We won 2nd place. We didn't expect to get it, especially I am proud of it. Our victory was warmly welcomed by the department teachers, so proud of us that they put up posters of our victory in our department building.</p>
